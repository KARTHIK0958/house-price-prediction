# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model built with Python and scikit-learn to predict house prices based on various features. Linear regression is used to model the relationship between the independent variables (house features) and the dependent variable (house price).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset from Kaggle. It includes a wide range of features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset in CSV format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for model building, prediction, and evaluation.
